I was born and raised in Potsdam, NY.  I am currently 21 years old.  I am just starting my senior year of college at St. Lawrence University, where I am majoring in economics.  My favorite animal is horses, because I love spending my time with the two horses that I own.  I love to keep myself busy and have multiple jobs, one is at my family's buisness, a local movie theater, as well as a coach at a local figure skating club.  


## My Hobbies 
I love to spend a lot of my free time riding my two horses that I own.  When Im not at the barn I can usally be found at the ice rink, either coaching or figure skating myself.  I also love to hang out with my friends in my free time.  I love being outside and spending time on the water going boating, jet skiing, and swiming.
